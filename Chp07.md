# Chapter 07: Control Flow - While Loops

- syntax: ```while (condition):```
- remember to add ":" colon symbol at the end of the while statement.
- the codes inside the while loop cannot be aligned with the first line of the while statement, it should be one indentation different from the first line.
- To escape the while loop, just simply align the code with the first line of while statement.

## Example 1
```python
n = 16    # initialize the n
while n<=20:
    print(n)
    n = n + 1    # student always forget n increment / decrement 
```
