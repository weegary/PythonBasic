# Chapter 03: Operators

As a programming laguage, python can do several operation.

**Arithmetic Operators** are used with numeric values for mathematical calculation.
|Operator|Name|Example|
|---|---|---|
|+|Addition|x + y|
|-|Substraction|x - y|
|*|Multiplication|x * y|
|/|Division|x / y|
|%|Modulus|x % y|
|**|Exponentiation|x ** y|
|//|Floor Division|x // y|

**Assignment Operators** are used to assign values to variables.
|Operator|Example|Same As|
|---|---|---|
|=|x = 5|x = 5|
|+=|x += 5|x = x + 5|
|-=|x -= 5|x = x - 5|
|*=|x *= 5|x = x * 5|
|/=|x /= 5|x = x / 5|
|%=|x %= 5|x = x % 5|
|**=|x **= 5|x = x ** 5|
|//=|x //= 5|x = x // 5|
|&=|x &= 5|x = x & 5|
|\|=|x \|= 5|x = x \| 5|

**Comparison Operators** are used to compare two values.
|Operator|Name|Example|
|---|---|---|
|==|Equal|x == y|
|!=|Not Equal|x != y|
|>|Greater Than|x > y|
|<|Less Than|x < y|
|>=|Greater Than or Equal To |x >= y|
|<=|Less Than or Equal To|x <= y|

**Logical Operators** are used to combine conditional statements.
|Operator|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|and|Return True When Both Statements Are True|x > 0 and x < 5|
|or|Return True When One of The Statements Is True|x > 0 or x < 5|
|not|Reverse The Result, Return True When The Result Is False|not(x > 0)|

**Identity Operators** are used to compare the objects, not to determine whether they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location.
|Operator|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|is|Return True When Both Variables Are The Same Object|x is y|
|is not|Return True When Both Variables Are Not The Same Object|x is not y|

**Membership Operators** are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object.
|Operator|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|in|Return True If a Sequence With The Specified Value Is Present In The Object|x in y|
|not in|Return True If a Sequence With The Specified Value Is Not Present In The Object|x is not y|
